I was wondering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any mod that enables you to build a setup that simulates this behavior?<br>
Say a belt splitter that stops if the accumulator charge is above 90% and starts if it’s below 105?</li>

<li>Is there a mod that has generators with this property? (“the resource consumption is automatically lowered”)</li>

          <title>[Suggestion] Power grid overload</title>

              <p>Scenario:<br>
Lights start to flicker. Machines slow down. Something is going on, but what?<br>
Oh?.. .wait… what’s smoking over there? is one of the generators over at the coal power plant on fire?<br>
Oh dear, I shouldn’t have overloaded the power grid. I knew loading the power grid to 105% was a bad idea. With one of the generators out the factory is now overloading the grid to 130% instead, and the other generators will take too much damage and catch fire too. I better turn machines off and save what’s left of the power plant!</p>
<p>Yea that’s the idea I have for a mod: Grid overload.<br>
Instead of tripping the fuse when hitting 100.000001% power consumption, I’d imagine things to slow down and flicker. The more one overloads the grid, the slower things run.</p>
<p>Say that one overloads the grid to 113%, the machine will only run at 87% of their set speed.  Machines efficiency on overloaded grid:  Machine_speed% - (Current_grid_load% - Max_grid_Load%)</p>
<p>If a connected generator is damaged (due to overheating as a result of being overloaded) it drops power output lowering the grid efficiency. (Reducing Max_grid_load%)<br>
Let’s say the generators won’t start to reduce their output until 25% damaged or more. After that, the output reduces as it gets more damaged until it reaches a critical failure point where it will be irreparable. The whole unit has to be replaced instead of repaired.</p>
<p>Example on a machine at 100% speed: 100-(113-100) = 87% speed.<br>
Example on a machine at 66% speed (underclocked) 66-(113-100) = 53% speed.<br>
Example on a machine at 100% speed with only 80% grid efficiency: 100-(113-80) = 67% speed.<br>
If the result is zero or less, the machine grinds to a halt.<br>
If the grid load is less than Max_grid_load%, nothing applies. (Normal status)</p>
<p>As one can see, overloading will have cascading effects. How long one can run overloaded depends on how much punishment generations can take. Maybe it is worth to overload 125% for a short while just to get that few extra steel pipes out a wee bit faster. One can repair the generators later on.</p>
<p>What purpose would such a mod have? Benefits with added risks. Instead of suddenly tripping a fuse, things will still run, but at a cost.</p>
<p>Those who played Factorio (another factory building game, but 2D) kinda recognise this behaviour. There the power grid overload causes everything to slow down. Although with no damaging results.</p>
<p>Would this be doable as a mod?</p>

              <p>The more my factory grows the harder it is to keep track if everything is working as expected. In order to get informed in time when things start to go down, I’d love to have some alerting available: My simple idea is to add a watcher to a belt which counts the number of items passing by. When the amount of a given item per minute falls below a given threshold, an alert is displayed to me in GUI or in some kind of dashboard.</p>
<p>I’ve searched existing mods for this functionality, but didn’t find anything. Do you know any mod doing something similar?</p>

I’ve been playing on the 100+ milestones mod pack for about 80 hours now, got the tier 29. Game would occasionally crash while playing, always assumed it was a GPU issue (I have a 2060 6GB of VRAM with 16GB of RAM). But now I went to launch it today and it wouldn’t load in and crash on start-up, 3 most recent autosaves same story, my last physical save from 12 hrs prior loaded, after no hope just played on that to work back up to where I was. After about 30 mins I saved and reloaded the save to verify it would work. After a few hours I fell off the side of the map and went to re-load the most recent autosave and same story. But this time that save also didn’t load, only the one from 12 hours prior. Please any input would be nice, I can post the crash log if desired since it only takes me a bout a min to re-create it. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
<p>So lately I had issues with Fluid AWESOME Sink mod crashing the game on startup (after splash, not getting to main menu). I have eliminated all other options and it is only due to the Fluid AWESOME Sink mod.<br>
It doesn’t seem to be related to some other mod (inter-mod compatibility), but just problematic on it’s own.</p>
<p>I’ve got a crash report but couldn’t attach it here.</p>

              <p>Due to the game’s limited types of lighting sources and all being too large, it’d be very nice if we have more options for interior and exterior lighting designs. It’s impossible to do indirect lighting designs or light stripes and even though some mod contains a 1m wall with lights, it doesn’t reflect the actual light on other surfaces so that can’t be counted as a lighting source because it doesn’t light up that space.</p>

<p>So my question is that has something else been added to the mod to get it to work so that the game will load. I been checking the documents every other day for any updates. And there doesn’t seem to be any changes made from update 4. Does anyone have any idea on what could be wrong?</p>

              <p>So I’m not a modder, for Satisfactory or otherwise. Unfortunately, a brainworm has crawled inside my skull and manifested into a mod idea that just won’t leave me alone. So I commit it to digital text here, in the hopes that it will infest some other poor sod and leave me be.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I need to put it out there in an interesting way, otherwise it won’t be exorcised. So here we go:</p>
<h1>===================================<br>
SATISFACTORY / COMMAND &amp; CONQUER:<br>
TIBERIAN FORGE</h1>
<p>"Good afternoon, Engineers. You are all here because you volunteered for this detachment; on behalf of GDI, humanity and life itself, I salute you and thank you for your dedicated and loyal service.</p>
<p>"This mission is both severely divergent from operational procedure and hazardous in the extreme. Nevertheless, needs must; given the lack of options available at this point in time, this course affords the greatest chance of saving this world from the encroachment of Tiberium. While all of you have been briefed on the mission, I will reiterate the salient details for the record.</p>
<p>"At 0245 hours shipboard time two days ago, Scout vessel <em>Andronicus</em> of the GDI Extrasolar Exploratory Corps moved into orbit around the life-bearing planet designated “Massage-2(AB)B” and began scans of the planet’s surface. It was at this time that the saboteur struck; a Brotherhood of NOD infiltrator among the crew was captured in an attempt to destroy the ship by detonating a suborned missile within the armament bays. The bridge Weapons Officer was able to spot the access breach in time and disable the warhead remotely.</p>
<p>"I… almost wish the saboteur had succeeded in his attempt. His contingency plan was… is… far worse. While the warhead itself was disabled, the missile was not, and before he was captured, he launched it at the planet below… carrying a shard of active Tiberium. High-intensity scans are already showing weak Tiberium emission frequencies from the point of planetary impact. In other words, the planet has been contaminated… and if nothing is done, it will be consumed as Earth was.</p>
<p>"The <em>Andronicus</em> is not equipped with the necessary materiel for full-scale Tiberium remediation; the only option is for the ship to return to GDI Command and report the need for a Reclamator detachment. However, every day’s transit is a day in which Tiberium is free to spread through the biosphere of a virgin world. This is unacceptable. Hence, this mission, for which you, the brave men and women of GDI’s Engineering Corps, have volunteered.</p>
<p>"Your mission is simple: abatement, containment and if possible eradication of Tiberium on the world below. You will deploy to the planet by orbital drop pods; unfortunately, we have no field units to deploy with you. You will have to make use of the tools available to you, especially your Field Constructors, to assemble the structures, hardware and materials needed to suppress the spread of Tiberium.</p>
<p>“Good luck, and may God be with you all.”</p>
<p>============================</p>
<p>This is basically a proposal for a Total Conversion multiplayer mod that radically changes the game’s objectives. The players are on a clock; the longer the game goes on, the more the Tiberium spreads and the more dangerous the world becomes. Players start with the majority of blueprints and gear unlocked, and their suits have built-in immunity to gas and radiation… but Tiberium is an environmental hazard all its own, and any fauna that survive Tib exposure become more deadly.</p>
<p>I’m under no illusions that a mod like this would be anything other than massively difficult to make; while some of the code in the game might be adaptable (e.g. the Radar Tower’s scanning pattern could maybe be used to calculate the spread of Tiberium per hourly tick), overall it would probably be a complete nightmare to code something like this. Still, I hope this inspires somebody to build <em>something</em>.</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
<p>Not sure if I’m only one having this, but there seems to be issue with placing walls after update 5.</p>
<p>If I place for example 5 walls vertically one by one and next to that place 5 walls vertically using Smart Mod (scrolling mouse wheel), there is small cap/height difference of these 5 walls. It looks like spacing is little off, when using Smart Mod. Same happens also placing walls horizontally.</p>
<p>Added screenshot that probably explains issue better.<br>

              <p>I’d like to learn how to create basic mods for Satisfactory.</p>
<p>I’ve had the idea on my mind to create a mod which can change the train horn sound effects and introduce a new track signal which causes trains to sound their horns upon passage.</p>
<p>The purpose being that my hub and mall are located at the middle of a very busy central rail hub which sees a lot of high speed train traffic.  (Up to 200 kph.)  It would be nice to be able to hear these screaming fast inbound trains well in advance over the game’s music and the ambient noise of the area.</p>
<p>Would anyone be willing to walk me through the basic steps of setting up the modding environment and building something like this?  I’m sh*t when it comes to software so this sort of thing I’ll never be able to figure out without help.</p>

              <p>I don’t see anything in the Launcher today indicating that my game’s about to crash on launch, but I do understand it’s a matter of waiting for mod updates (for me, it’s Passive Mode, More Milestones, and Kraigsta Milestones).  Is it simply “try it every few days and see”, or something more subtle than that?</p>

              <p>Hello!<br>
I couldn’t find the info anywhere, so, really sorry if it’s the case and I missed it:</p>
<p>Are mods currently expected to work on a SF dedicated server?</p>
<p>I tried with the very naive approach of copying the mod directory from a working EA client, and the server failed to load the modules.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

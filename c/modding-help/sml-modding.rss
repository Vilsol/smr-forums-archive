              <p>Hi everyone, I have a problem loading mods with SML 3.01 and 3.1.1<br>
let me explain, I have an unofficial version of Satisfactory 151773. I installed both SML 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 and starting the game everything seems to be fine, bottom left under the Build version tells me how many mods are loaded and I can see them all but starting the game no mod is active except " SMART! " that works in part. that is, only the duplication of the blocks to be placed, not even the menu can be opened to configure it.<br>
obviously I am not using SMM due to the fact that my version is not official, I wanted to know if there is a way to solve because with SML 2.2.1 everything works fine but there are many mods that I cannot install because they require SML 3.0.0</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/happyjamcoding">@HappyJamCoding</a>, just dropping you a line to let you know I enjoyed using FoundationIndustries previously.  I have recently picked Satisfactory up again after Update 4 and wondered if you were still supporting FoundationIndustries and if there might be a compatible version soon.  Thanks for all your hard work, and I hope to see a new version!</p>

IS it any Beta version that we can test out? Im happy to test a Beta version of the Manager if it is someone that are working with it. I know the New Game engie of unreal enige is on the experimental version and that version they have inplented a difrent way of adding mods to the game its even easier in that version so its strange if it is noone that is working on this alredy :)<img src="https://forums.ficsit.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> And I and maybe alot of other people are willing to test it out also its np.</p>

          <title>Refined Power, Modular Power Design Beta Testing</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[@I_m_a_chicken29 Im A Chicken29]]></dc:creator>

              <p><strong>Hello there everyone!</strong></p>
<p>We have decided to try something new that is doing a private beta testing campaign and will do more in the future if it goes well. we are doing this so we can get a lot more feedback on the update than having to push it out than get the public feedback and bug reports and then have to change stuff leading to breaking people’s game or making someone redo buildings.<br>
What this is, is that people can beta test the next update to Refined Power, Modular Power Design (MPD for short).</p>
<p>Beta Testing will start on Monday, July 27th, 2020 10am BST or 11am CEST and ending on aug 8th<br>
but will be open till the update drops for patreons only</p>
<p>What you will be doing is playing an unreleased version of Refined Power with this new update (Mk1 stuff only atm) and give us feedback. You will give us feedback/bug reports on the update on the Refined Power <a href="https://discord.gg/CgMn3wQ" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord</a> with a custom role to have access to a private chat. For the people who do have access to beta test please do not share the version to other people without our consent. remember anything in this update is subject to change with the feedback that we get!</p>
<p><strong>Important Info Below</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do I get the discord role?</strong><br>
Msg me I’m_a_chicken29#9014 on discord or Mrhid6#2851 and send us some sort of proof that you qualify for who can be a beta tester down below!</p>
<p><strong>Who will have access to the private beta testing?</strong><br>
Only Mod devs, All Patreon supporters, trusted friends, and YouTuber/streamers (Streaming only and no need to private/unlist it afterward). Please do not ask us for the custom version of the mod if you don’t fit any of the roles above! Please do understand our reasoning as to why down below as for why it’s not public.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it only x people above who can do the beta testing?</strong><br>
Making Beta testing public will just lead to a lot more issues if you think about it more and more F.e: teaching people how to install the mod, people thinking it’s some update they can play on while all of in it can be changed, etc</p>
<p><strong>will this happen again?</strong><br>
Maybe if it goes to plan, which we hope it does.</p>

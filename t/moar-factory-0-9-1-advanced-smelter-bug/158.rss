    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/moar-factory-0-9-1-advanced-smelter-bug/158</link>
    <description>I just noticed that everytime i try to place advanced smelter part of the building is underground and it is basicly impossible to connect input/output to anything. As you can see on image

So you cant place it on foundation and if you place it on ground, you cant work with it. :smiley:

Btw. I have fresh game and only mods i am using are Moar factory, Farming mod, Light it up and Renewable Energy</description>

              <p>I have found the same problem, the placement reference of the machine seems to have been assigned to the centre instead of the base, so you always get an encroachment on a foundation or it is buried in the ground.</p>
<p>[edit]<br>
Got a workaround using Area Actions mod.  Place a smelter in the ground, then you can use AA to ‘select a building’ and use the copy action to raise it out of the ground. Set Z to 5 and paste with “OK”, then dismantle the original smelter. Once it’s out of the ground you can see that the model is incomplete, there is a lot of space under it and the ports connect to nothing.<br>
It also appears that you cannot connect belts to the ports if you try to snap to the bottom edge of a port. For some reason the snap point is near the top of the ports, so aim there when connecting belts and they will connect properly to the bottom edge.</p>

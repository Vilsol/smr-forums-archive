    <title>Updating my Project files to CSS build 40</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/updating-my-project-files-to-css-build-40/1323</link>
    <description>I download both the project files and the CSS build 40. I ran Wwise and set it up. Then I run VS and do a shipping build on it and then I start the editor and started the Init Build. I keep getting an error that wanted me to rebuild again manually. Well, I tried that and got the same results. 

I already got kicked or banned from the discord server when asking for help on this matter. I&#39;m just about ready to quit playing this game and getting my money back on it and filing a discord complaint. I read through the docs again and again and I still get the same issue.

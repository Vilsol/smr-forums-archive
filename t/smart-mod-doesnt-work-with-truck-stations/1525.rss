    <title>SMART Mod doesn&#39;t work with truck stations</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/smart-mod-doesnt-work-with-truck-stations/1525</link>
    <description>Was attempting to lay out a row of stations and it wasn&#39;t responsive to the smart mod key commands.  I changed to building smelters just to verify if the mod was working right, and that worked correctly, but stations not so much.</description>

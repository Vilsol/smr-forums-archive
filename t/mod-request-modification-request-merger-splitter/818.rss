    <title>Mod Request/Modification request - Merger/Splitter</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/mod-request-modification-request-merger-splitter/818</link>
    <description>There is currently a merger / splitter mod that has 3 models, was wondering if it was possible to recreate that mod but have it just 1 merger splitter but adjustable sizes, so that you can scale it to your factory easier. Much appreciated.</description>

    <description>Would be nice to have a little mod to modify the RSS Scanner behaviour such that if a deposit has a miner on top, it get&#39;s ignored thus not showing up. That way we don&#39;t walk in circles in order to find new deposits. No idea how complicated that is in terms of modding or if it&#39;s even possible, but maybe someone with some modding experience wants to have a look. :slight_smile:</description>

              <p>Aye, there’s a couple of workarounds for it. Still i don’t really understand why the scanner function the way it does in game right now. Maybe an oversight? Who knows. But i know there are maps/save editors out there that DO have the functionality to hide the already exploited nodes, meaning the game already has a way to track that. And that’s what i’ll keep doing for the time being, use external maps. Until the scanner get’s more useful. Coz’ as of now, unless i travel a few kilometers away from my base, there’s nothing new that the scanner can point out for me anymore :)).</p>

              <p>This idea sounds quite interesting…</p>
<p>I generally use the scanner with the in-game map function as well you can get a fair idea of the locations of resources even if you haven’t been in that area yet.</p>
<p>Also would be a nice idea be able use parts of satisfactory-calculator website in game which has an extremely detailed map of where resources are.</p>
<p>Personally I also use named beacons at my miners so if a ping matches the miner it sort of hides it anyway. (i.e. Iron ORE § x 2 as its description with silver colored icon).</p>

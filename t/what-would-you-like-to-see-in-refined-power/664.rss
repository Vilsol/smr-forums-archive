    <description>We have an upcoming update to RP (Refined Power) that includes gas power and we thought what would you like to see coming to RP? We have never asked this question before other than taking suggestions and doing bug/balancing reports and we would like to see what you would want to see coming to the mod! We will take almost any idea if possible or we are up to do it so please do tell us what you would like to see come to the mod!




IMPORTANT!: What &quot;we&quot; means is me and Mrhid6, and I got permission to post this about asking you guys what y&#39;all want!.</description>

              <p>I agree. Batteries would be a great addition. I have remote miners and put multiple bio-generetors around them just so i can put plenty of bio-fuel in them so they can run for a while on their own. Would love to manage batteries there and charge them from the bio-fuel while I am around to check on things. Also for handling spikes and shortages. Since energy is such a major asset in this game. Handling charging/discharging &amp; all would be nice.<br>
Chargable vehicles would be cool too.</p>

              <p>It would be nice if you can continue to focus on balance with the vanilla game.  One additional thing would be a way to process nuclear waste: there is a basic mod that cheats it away, and an extremely complex mod that requires 12 different resources to get rid of it. If you… maybe you could make nuclear waste a usable resource in the one of the arc reactors or dyson sphere to provide some incentive to develop the nuclear plant and go beyond that.</p>

Something like the Awsome sink in, but delivers power from it.</p>

A small device that you can hook up to your pipeline after it went downhill for a while.</p>

              <p>also the solar power can be much much more refined… i would prefer the core unit with the batteries should be a different structures on its own then users will build the sollar array themselves and connect it to the core…</p>
<p>i really enjoyed solar power and i think it can be improved so much… having individual solar array into solar farm… and also maybe advanced solar power is by having a solar farm focusing sun to a steam generator as it is done in real life</p>

              <p>hello may i suggest several ideas for “Energy Storage”? Batteries are boring and feels low tier, there are several grid-scale energy storage system we actually have for real, i would like to suggest 2 of those:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fancier gravity based system being developed by a startup in europe<br>
<a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a29463165/concrete-block-energy-storage/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a29463165/concrete-block-energy-storage/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a more straight forward compressed energy storage (usually in form of gas or water) where unused energy are powering pumps to convert energy to something tangible like water and then when there is a need, in case of water, it is pumped back into a hydro turbine to convert back the pumped water into electricity (which the mod already has one) and for a storage we do have tanks in game! this will create a more complex uses of those already in-game assets for new practical uses</p>
</li>
</ul>

Even for just the base game without solar, some sort of capacitance device would be hugely beneficial for covering load spikes, and preventing the need to extremely over-engineer your power production.</p>

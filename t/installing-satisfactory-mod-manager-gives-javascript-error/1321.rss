    <title>Installing Satisfactory Mod Manager gives Javascript error</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/installing-satisfactory-mod-manager-gives-javascript-error/1321</link>
    <description>Hi there. I have recently started playing Satisfactory and I was trying to install the Satisfactory Mod Manager off the home page of ficsit.app and ran into a little problem... This is the very first time that I am trying to install mods and or mod managers onto Satisfactory and after an hour or so of googling and youtube-ing I still haven&#39;t found any forum or video related to my issue.

This is the error that I get, without the Mod Manager actually opening. I just installed it (for the 5 billionth time) again and this is what I get when I click finish when the &#39;launch Satisfactory Mod Manager&#39; checkbox is checked:

I hope someone can help...

These were the steps I took after downloading the latest Mod Manager from the homepage link:

* List item Opened Mod Manager &#39;.exe&#39; file as admin
* List item Selected &#39;anyone who uses this computer&#39; option
* List item Left folder as it was (same disk as Steam directory for Satisfactory)
* List item Hit &#39;Install&#39;
* List item Hit &#39;Finish&#39; with checkbox &#39;Run Satisfactory Mod Manager&#39; checked

After this the error shows up, same for any version of the manager I try to install.</description>

    <description>@HappyJamCoding, just dropping you a line to let you know I enjoyed using FoundationIndustries previously.  I have recently picked Satisfactory up again after Update 4 and wondered if you were still supporting FoundationIndustries and if there might be a compatible version soon.  Thanks for all your hard work, and I hope to see a new version!</description>

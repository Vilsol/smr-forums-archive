              <p>The version of the application has nothing to do with the version of the applications it interfaces to. If they have an internal split in the code, I donâ€™t care. All I see is one program managing the interface to two separate build trees of Satisfactory. The internals of the code do not concern me. And as noted above, someone was needlessly confused because v2.0 is used for one thing, v2.1 another thing, and v1.0.x for a third. From now on I will only refer to the version 1.0.x version of the SML program and ignore the rest. (Except for the specific build numbers of Satisfactory of course.)</p>

              <p>I think they did it that way because the last few experimental releases have had big changes made to the core of them and they are trying to stabilize the mod launcher for both versions without it causing existing mods to stuff up massively. (Which is basically what has been happening with most mods in the last week or so.)</p>

Never seen it done this way anywhere. One program, one version. That is how it is done.</p>

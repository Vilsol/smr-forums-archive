    <title>Mod suggestion for the coffee cup and inhalers</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/mod-suggestion-for-the-coffee-cup-and-inhalers/854</link>
    <description>I would love a mod that puts inhalers in the coffee cup (like how you can put ammo in a gun) and any time you take a sip from the coffee you use an inhaler. I don&#39;t know where to even start with modding sadly. Does anyone who knows how to do this have any interest in teaching me or making this mod?

Thanks</description>

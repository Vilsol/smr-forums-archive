    <description>Hi all, well since the 28/6/2021 and the v2.5.0 update, I have not been able to use the mod manager and every time I try to use it I get the same message.

I have uninstalled it, reinstalled so many times I gave up counting, I have even remove all my mods and game save, all to no effect it still keeps displaying the same message.

![SML%20Error%20Message|690x389](upload://6I6aG1jtv4yqzmFre27VdmQCn8u.jpeg) 

Also I am not able to access discord to find help their.

I have finally found the cause of this and it is any incompatibility with with one of my security software programs ( Malwarebytes ).</description>

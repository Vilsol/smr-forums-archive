    <description>Was playing Satisfactory with mods no problems. SMM 2.4.2 and SML 3.0 Steam version. Then when I logged out it updated to SML 3.1.0 and SMM 2.4.4 and  Steam version updated and now nothing works even after reloading SMM over and over. I keep getting error of Mod Helper not found and it kicks me out. Installed again 15 times literally and still same thing. Will not generate debug either.</description>

              <p>Thanks. Got it working except on the mod web site there is no longer the “Install” button just the “View” button.  And it shows no mods in my profile now. But I can do  search in the SMM and install them that way.  Just annoying. but works. Gave permissions to firewall and everything you can think of, but no more Install button <img src="https://forums.ficsit.app/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>I’ve been using SMM 2.4.3 and had the same issue.</p>
<p>I’ve sorted it by setting the SMM ‘update settings’ to ‘ask’, then reinstalled v.2.4.3 and re-updated the mods to work with that version. I was finding that every time I tried to install 2.4.3 it was automatically updating to 2.4.4 which doesn’t work with EA.</p>
<p>Perhaps this will help.</p>

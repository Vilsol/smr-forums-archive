    <description>So, today I finally got this working after turning of one of my security programs and removing faulty mods, only for it to crash my game.

It would seem that there is some sort of compatibility issue with UE4, as that is what is crashing when I try to launch the game.

And so developers what are you going to about this, as I am getting very, very, very angry with this!!</description>

    <description>Hey cepheidqq, you chose &quot;R&quot; as the UI opening key for your mod; that conflicts with the game&#39;s default &quot;Reload&quot; key, which is a commonly used key and isn&#39;t likely to be rebound by most players.  Might want to change that, or maybe make it configurable.</description>

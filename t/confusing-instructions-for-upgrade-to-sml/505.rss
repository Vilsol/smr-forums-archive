    <title>Confusing instructions for upgrade to SML</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/confusing-instructions-for-upgrade-to-sml/505</link>
    <description>Hi,

When a new version of SML is available the instructions say we can get in from it&#39;s url but also says we don&#39;t have to. This can cause confusion.

Can it be clear as to whether we have to download the install or if it&#39;ll auto update itself when closed.

Cheers</description>

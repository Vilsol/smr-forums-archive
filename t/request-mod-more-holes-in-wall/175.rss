    <title>Request mod : More holes in wall</title>

    <description>Suggestion for mod more holes in wall.
Currently you are limited to 3 types of walls with holes to get your belts trough, you have no flexibility.
I have fund out that you can clip trough walls Spliters/mergers, and they still will be transporting item over the wall.
However there is small drawback, on one side you can have neat clean access/exit, but on the other side you still stuck with the rest of the spliter/merger.

So If any moder can create something like that but to be on both sides, or just simple hole witch can be placed anywhere on wall.
Here is example what am talking about https://imgur.com/fwE6QN0</description>

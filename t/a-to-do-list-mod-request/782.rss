    <title>A to do list mod request?</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/a-to-do-list-mod-request/782</link>
    <description>A few friends on stream came up with an idea to make a mod that makes a to do list similar to buildings however instead resources and just things to do i.e. build coal plant. I personally don&#39;t have any experience whatsoever with programming or how difficult something like this would take considering it would add some kind of U.I. I&#39;m sure the community would love something like this!</description>

              <p>Simple notepad also might be helpful for calculating your production lines.</p>
<p>It may be as interface feature or even cooler: it may be an inventory object and you can place notes near some places in factory to which them are related.</p>
<p>Whow, that would be really awesome!</p>

    <title>Help with multiplayer modding</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/help-with-multiplayer-modding/108</link>
    <description>So i understand there is next to no multiplayer support for multiplayer with mods, however I read a lot of people don&#39;t have problems. I am hosting a modded server and it runs fine until a friend joins then i crash. Is there a mod list of the ones that work in multiplayer better than others so i know which mods to start pulling or keeping?</description>

              <p>Adding mods for MP is a trial and Error even, Try one mod at a time. then add them until the game crashes. Yes I lot said they got it to work and many others said it didn’t work at all. I know I tried this. it’s the only thing you can do. For some unknown reason it did work for some gamers. Just not everyone wanting there friend to join their world, It just don’t work for everyone.</p>

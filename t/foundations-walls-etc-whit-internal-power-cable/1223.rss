    <title>Foundations/walls etc Whit internal Power cable</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/foundations-walls-etc-whit-internal-power-cable/1223</link>
    <description>Has anyone else had an idea about foundations that had internal Power lines build into.

I have been founding myself thinking about something like this:

Foundation 8X4, with direct power line: cost 6 concrete and 1 cable.
Foundation 8x4, with crossed power line: cost 6 concrete and 2 cable.
Foundation 8x4, cable outlet Up, which you can use, for example, as a source for a normal electrical pole

this could be used in walls etc.

If there is already Mod like this out, i would love to get a link for it.

thanks in advance, best regards

    <title>Menu Adjusting Mod Idea</title>

    <description>I think a nice addition to the mod market is a mod that can allow you to adjust the placement of the &quot;Hands&quot; and &quot;Body&quot; slots. Got a lot of mods that add more slots, which causes overlapping if you try to use too many of them. Would really like to still have all those slots and be able to access them.</description>

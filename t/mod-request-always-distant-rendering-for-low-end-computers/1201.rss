    <title>[Mod Request] Always distant rendering for low-end computers</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/mod-request-always-distant-rendering-for-low-end-computers/1201</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have a request for what I hope is a simple mod. I noticed that distant objects have lower res textures and simplified geometry. Is it possible to make a mod that would render everything like this regardless of how close the player is? 

My laptop used to be a decent gaming laptop, but it&#39;s getting kind of old and I get frequent frame rate issues even with all my graphics settings at their minimum. I realize it might look really terrible for everything to be rendered like it&#39;s far away, but I think it would really be worth the stable frame rate.

Would anyone like to make this mod for me?

In any case, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on the matter. And thanks for your time.</description>

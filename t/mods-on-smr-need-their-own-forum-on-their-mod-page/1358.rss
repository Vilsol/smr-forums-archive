    <title>Mods on SMR need their own forum on their /mod/ page</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/mods-on-smr-need-their-own-forum-on-their-mod-page/1358</link>
    <description>As much as I appreciate and love this site, and many of the mods hosted here, there have been several mods that are causing crashes and **multi-gigabyte** error logs, with the authors of those mods having absolutely zero means of contacting them or giving feedback.

This type of communication is *essential* for mods, and gives ficsit.app the dubious distinction of being the first mod repository I&#39;ve ever seen that doesn&#39;t make it easy to contact authors with bugs.

Please, for the love of all things shiny, correct this glaring oversight. Your users like me will thank you. :)

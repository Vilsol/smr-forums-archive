    <description>Hello! 

I have been using some satisfactory online tools for planning my factory, but I never really satisfied with them. So what&#39;s better then? A custom tool!

[Satis-Factory Manager](https://zechy.cz/satisfactory/#/) is a online tool that allows you planning your factories from scratch. Grouping buildings together, see production and power overall statistics. And manage imports &amp; exports between your factories.

Power management here is not only about production buildings, but about every thinkable building, that consumes power. From lights to Locos!

You can try my [tool here](https://zechy.cz/satisfactory/#/).</description>

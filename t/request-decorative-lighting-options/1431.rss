    <title>REQUEST: Decorative lighting options</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/request-decorative-lighting-options/1431</link>
    <description>I wanted to create a couple of smaller spaces in my factory like an office or lounge, but the default options lack variety and are either too large, or create a lot of glare when placed in a smallish (8m tall) area. The More Decorations mod has a couple of nice looking lamps, which is the sort of thing I want, but they only have a glow effect and don&#39;t emit any actual light. 

I would create something myself, but I only have very basic coding knowledge. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</description>

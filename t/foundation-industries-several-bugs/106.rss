    <description>Hello there. Just wanted to point out several bugs I&#39;ve noticed with the mod.
1. Every time I load up a save with the mod, more and more listings for all 3 of the milestones show up in the hub terminal. At this point I have 5 of the corners, 6 ramps and 7 glass.
2. Every time I&#39;m in the terminal, I&#39;m getting spam in the SML console window.
&quot;IsSchematicPaidOff failed, schematic was null.&quot;
&quot;UFGSchematic::GetSchematicDisplayName, class was nullpeter.&quot;
&quot;GetPaidOffCostFor failed, schematic was null.&quot;

FYI, I have 109075 build of the game, 1.0.2 SML, 0.8.0 MoarFactory, 1.2.0 Foundations-Industries, 1.0.1 SID, 0.1.1 Advanced Logistics, 0.2.2 Light It Up and I&#39;m using 0.3.2 KronosMod.</description>

    <title>Hugh Stacks Vs Update 3</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/hugh-stacks-vs-update-3/185</link>
    <description>Items stack to 500 however I could not work with Copper after using the mod, the game would crash selecting copper builds in a constructor.  I could not refine copper manually because it would always tell me not enough space.
I removed the mod and it would still stack.  I removed the mod and started a new game and it would still stack.
I had to uninstall and delete all saves to get copper to work again.</description>

              <p>I am not a modding pro, but I think the problem lies in the SML version. They havenâ€™t made an SML for update 3, therefore the mod does not load properly. Its basically configured to the older version of the game. We just need to wait until the updated SML gets released.</p>

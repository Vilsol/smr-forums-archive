    <description>Has anyone been frustrated that ALL of the light in satisfactory point down? How about some lights that can be pointed up towards building? I sure there&#39;s a modder out there that can make this happen.</description>

              <p>I think the ’ Light It Up’ mod used to have a light that did that.<br>
But it was never updated after release 4.<br>
I think the implementation of lights in that mod was better than what is included in the game now.</p>

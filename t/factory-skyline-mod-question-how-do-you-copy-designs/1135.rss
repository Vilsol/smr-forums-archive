    <description>Factory Skyline Mod Question - How do you copy Designs?

I accidentally made a copy of one of my designs... it appeared as copy_designName in the list. I would like to know how to do this so I can back up a design when I go and tinker with it.

I am NOT talking about placing it in the game world.... I mean copying the actual design in the Skyline UI so I have two designs with different names that are identical.

Also, while I am here.. how do you move designers into folders?, and delete folders?

Thanks!</description>

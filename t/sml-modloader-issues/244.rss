    <description>Hi all,
Is there any way to manually install mods?
To cut a long story short I modified the Satisfactory install to a different hard drive (that in itself took ages to work out) 
So now my Satisfactory game resides on a SSD drive D: and runs perfectly without mods.

It would seem that the new modloader cannot find my new game path or that is what I think is happening and therefore fails.
I don&#39;t mind manually copying and pasting, creating paths or editing ini files to get the new modloader working. In fact in the past this is how I installed mods.
Please consider providing a manaual solution for users like myself who have issues with the new system. Its not like I am running an illegal version of Satisfactory, everything is legit.
Any help appreciated.</description>

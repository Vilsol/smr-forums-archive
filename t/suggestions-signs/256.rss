    <description>It would be nice if we could have signs that could be placed on a wall, conveyor or pipe with the texted entered by the user.  This would help in the organizing of the many conveyors and pipes.  It is easy to see what is on the conveyor but knowing where it is going to would be a nice use of these.</description>

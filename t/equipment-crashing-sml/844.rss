    <title>Equipment+ crashing SML</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/equipment-crashing-sml/844</link>
    <description>The mod has been crashing my SML for a little while now.  I get the following error message...

@@@@SML HAS CRASHED: Errors occurred during mod loading stage &#39;mod discovery&#39;.  Loading cannot continue:  Failed to load zip mod from D:\Program Files\Epic Games\SatisfactoryExperimental/Mods/Equipment+_0.0.1.smod(Invalid data.json) @@@@
Click OK to exit.

Anyone else getting this?  Is there a fix I&#39;ve missed?

I&#39;ve tried re-installing it and SML.  I&#39;ve tried renaming the mod, including the file references in the .smod file and the .json using the word &#39;EquipmentPlus&#39; instead of &#39;Equipment+&#39;.  It will launch without error, but doesn&#39;t load the files and so is not available in the game.  Then the next time I launch SML it notices the file has changed and reloads it to the original, which then crashes when I launch the game.

Any thoughts?</description>

              <p>it’s the Equipment+ mod it’s outdated just don’t use it and use EA branch not EXP since mods may not have support for it and not work</p>

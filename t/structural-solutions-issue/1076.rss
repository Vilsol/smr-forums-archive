    <description>Mike Skinner / D4rkL0rd -
Great mod, looks very nice.  There is an issue with your objects overlapping. When using the 8x8x1 block if you are targeting an existing block the game/nod will allow you to place another block over the existing one. This creates and issue when spam placing blocks where you end up with 2+ block in every space depending on where the targeting is when you are clicking as you run. Looks like the collision is not set up right to keep the objects from occupying the same space the way official foundations work.


Thanks!</description>

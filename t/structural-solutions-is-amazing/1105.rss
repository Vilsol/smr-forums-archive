    <description>I just snagged Structural Solutions by Mike Skinner (not sure if he is on discord) but it is a really well thought out addition to the game. Specifically designed to build superstructures for your factory, it is amazing at adding architecture to your builds. I hope that Mike will work with Smart @Algalish (Smart!)  &amp;  Factory Skyline (Cephidqq) to integrate these new parts into their modes.</description>

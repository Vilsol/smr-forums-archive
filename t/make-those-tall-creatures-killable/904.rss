    <title>Make those tall creatures killable</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/make-those-tall-creatures-killable/904</link>
    <description>i wasnt sure where to post this, but i was wondering if anyone would be willing to make those big tall walker things, you know the one&#39;s with beak, and legs, to make them killable or disable them all together, the reason i ask, is that no matter how many explosives i throw at them they just keep coming back, or they find ways into my factory buildings, it&#39;s a bloody nuisance...

thanks to anyone who can come up with a solution, to get rid of em permanently 
cheers</description>

              <p>O.o they are killiable. Takes a bit  of damage to kill em though. 10-13 strikes with the Xeno Basher I think.<br>
I build in the desert to avoid them and the flying magic carps in the green lush zones.</p>

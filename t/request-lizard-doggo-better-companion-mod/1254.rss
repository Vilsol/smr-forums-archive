    <title>REQUEST: Lizard Doggo Better Companion Mod</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/request-lizard-doggo-better-companion-mod/1254</link>
    <description>I love bringing around my Lizard Doggo when I&#39;m exploring, however he&#39;s slower than me when I&#39;m sprinting and he usually gets stuck on ridges. I would love to be able to carry him like this ![yooo|690x388](upload://oWQ7vuVMh3Ep6ahOOTFzpJpdtPi.jpeg)  or maybe carry him on a Equippable Pet Backpack. I would also be interested to see additional addons like being able to feed him, see his HP, pet him without opening his inventory and also pet commands where you can tell him to sit. Thank you in advance!</description>

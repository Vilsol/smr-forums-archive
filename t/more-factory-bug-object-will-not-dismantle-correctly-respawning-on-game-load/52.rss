    <title>More Factory BUG - Object will not dismantle correctly, respawning on game load</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/more-factory-bug-object-will-not-dismantle-correctly-respawning-on-game-load/52</link>
    <description>So I have a strange problem with More Factory, I am using the latest version.

Basically I was testing it out and used the &quot;wall plug&quot; item. This is a object that you can place on a sold wall to make a connection for a belt. The idea is you do not need to use doorways or anything, just normal walls and put in the &quot;holes&quot; were you like.

I tested this on a single spot.. but overtime I load the game there is another copy of the object at the spot. So after a week or so I may need to use dismantle and delete it 10 times. I have tried dismantling it, then saving immediately, but as soon as I load the game it is back.

Any ideas on what I can do about this?

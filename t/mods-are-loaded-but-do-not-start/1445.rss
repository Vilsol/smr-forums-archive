    <description>Hi everyone, I have a problem loading mods with SML 3.01 and 3.1.1
let me explain, I have an unofficial version of Satisfactory 151773. I installed both SML 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 and starting the game everything seems to be fine, bottom left under the Build version tells me how many mods are loaded and I can see them all but starting the game no mod is active except &quot; SMART! &quot; that works in part. that is, only the duplication of the blocks to be placed, not even the menu can be opened to configure it.
obviously I am not using SMM due to the fact that my version is not official, I wanted to know if there is a way to solve because with SML 2.2.1 everything works fine but there are many mods that I cannot install because they require SML 3.0.0</description>

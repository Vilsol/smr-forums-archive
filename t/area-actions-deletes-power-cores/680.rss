    <title>Area Actions Deletes Power Cores</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/area-actions-deletes-power-cores/680</link>
    <description>I just discovered a major bug with the Area Actions mod that required me to revert back a huge amount of changes. if you use the &quot;clear inventories&quot; action in machines with power cores it will destroy the power cores along with the machines inventory.

I don&#39;t know if its be reported yet but that is a major flaw that needs attention brought to it. Don&#39;t make my mistake and clear your entire factory to get things moving again then wonder why every fine tuned overclock suddenly feels like its going a lot slower.</description>

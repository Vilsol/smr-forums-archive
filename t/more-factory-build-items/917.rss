    <description>Hi All,
Dose anyone know if there is a mods or someone is working on a mod for more foundations, fences and walls?
I have almost finished my world for now and have areas in need of such things as 45-degree angle fences, more sizes for slopped walls and angled foundation that smoothly finish rather than just stopping.
I have skills to create one but thought Id check first.

Thx</description>

              <p>From a quick search on the mod portal, it looks like <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/36nirKGiJQ9wDc">Ramped Fences</a> and <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/3yYkSLEp1w7w5C">Sloped Walls</a> exist. Youâ€™d have to look around some more to see if there are similar ones for foundations.</p>

    <title>[Suggestion] hostile creatures ect</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/suggestion-hostile-creatures-ect/824</link>
    <description>Is custom creatures, ai, and structures geared toward base defense currently possible.

I was looking through steam forums and seen someone else more or less getting pissed and moaned at for suggesting it, but i&#39;m also interested in the idea so i figured id post and see if anyone could point me in the right direction on if its possible currently with the game,  [orginal thread on steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/526870/discussions/0/2798376550602307124/ )

eh maybe not as nebulous and loosely defined as a overhaul mod for the game, but maybe a creatures with a time table on spawn that respond to the player and structures, eh that may be a pain since i assume structures dont have any decay or health values...

Either way, on a scale of 0-10 with zero being impossible, how much of a punch in the dick would this be to make?</description>

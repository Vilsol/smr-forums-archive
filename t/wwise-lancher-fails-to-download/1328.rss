    <title>Wwise Lancher Fails to download</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/wwise-lancher-fails-to-download/1328</link>
    <description>Hi all, new modder here. I cant seem to download wwise from https://www.audiokinetic.com/download/
as the secure connection seems to fail. This to me indicates its the ssl at their end not mine but regardless is anyone else having this issue and is it a nessessary step? I am following along the guide to get started.

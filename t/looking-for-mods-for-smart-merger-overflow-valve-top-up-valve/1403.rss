    <title>Looking for mods for smart merger, overflow valve, top-up valve</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/looking-for-mods-for-smart-merger-overflow-valve-top-up-valve/1403</link>
    <description>While browsing the Official Satisfactory Q&amp;A board, I saw multiple posts from people requesting the following components be added:

* &#39;Smart&#39; conveyor merger which can prioritize taking from one input over another
* Overflow valve which releases fluid only when a pipe is full
* Top-up valve which adds fluid only when the destination is not full

In several cases, these posts had replies which claimed that there were mods that added such parts. However, none of those posts linked to specific mods, and I haven&#39;t been able to find any in the SMR myself. Does anyone know of any mods which add such things?</description>

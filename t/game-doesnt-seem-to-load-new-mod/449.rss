    <description>I just set it up last night. I have been watching the video on this and what a pain. anyway. I see the PAK and SIG files being made. It&#39;s just when I go in-game. That the mod doesn&#39;t show in-game in the milestone. anyone have an idea what would cause this and a fix for it.</description>

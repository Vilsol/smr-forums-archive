    <description>I downloaded the organized storage mod and i went into the game. I fell from a high place 10 minutes later and died. I respawned and my crate wasn&#39;t there and in the chat it said something about my items being in a special crate that i made or something. I don&#39;t remember making one of these or where my items have gone.</description>

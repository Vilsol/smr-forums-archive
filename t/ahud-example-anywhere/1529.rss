    <title>AHud example anywhere?</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/ahud-example-anywhere/1529</link>
    <description>Is it possible to add a hud to your mod? I want to access the UCanvas class to do some line drawing and I can only seem to do that through a AHud class. I see Satisfactory has a hud for the object scanner but I can&#39;t see the code they use to add this to the screen. I have found examples online but they involve setting the hud in the game mode and I don&#39;t think I have access to that.</description>

    <title>Is there a mod that places snap points on belts?</title>

    <description>I am new to the game. It seems abnormal that when you place a splitter/merger on a belt that it does not snap to the same points that a stand would pop up under it when over a foundation. Am I missing something, or is there a mod that does this?</description>

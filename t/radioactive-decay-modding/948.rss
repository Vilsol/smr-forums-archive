    <description>I am trying to play around with changing the Radioactive decay rates for some items, but I can&#39;t make sense of how the numbers are calculated.

On this page here, [Satisfactory Radiation](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Radiation) they measure Item Decay in whole numbers, Uranium has an Item Decay of 15, Nuclear Fuel Rod is 60, etc. In the Unreal Engine Blueprints, however, they have a value called Radioactive Decay that is a value between 0 and 1 where 0 is no radiation and 1 is &quot;the number of nucleus that decay per second...1 is 10^15 (1 Quadrillion) decays&quot;

I&#39;m not sure how these numbers are related. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any connection between them. I also can&#39;t find the actual values used for items like Uranium and Nuclear Fuel Rods as the projects made available only have default values of 0 for these items. If anyone knows how these numbers are related, can you please let me know.</description>

              <p>So I figured it out. It was poorly worded in Unreal Engine. The value that goes in this space is the same as the ItemDecay value on the Radiation page I posted above, so if you wanted to, say, double the radiation for Uranium, you would change the Radioactive Decay value to 30, for example.</p>
<p>For some reason, it says the value can only be between 0 and 1, but it can be any value you want.</p>

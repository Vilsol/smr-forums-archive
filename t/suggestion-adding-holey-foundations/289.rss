    <title>Suggestion: adding holey foundations</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/suggestion-adding-holey-foundations/289</link>
    <description>just a small suggestion here. adding ports/holes/snap-points in foundations so conveyor lifts can pass through the floor in an effort to have a more compact factory. similar to the half foundation or wall conveyor port from the moar factory mod or the fence floor from the fence(hazards?) mod.</description>

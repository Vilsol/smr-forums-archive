    <title>Mod idea will make ausom sink so much easyer</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/mod-idea-will-make-ausom-sink-so-much-easyer/1347</link>
    <description>I know I have been posting a lot presently but that its because I have mod ideas, bug&#39;s I have found, and general questions.
I am in a ticket race with my brother in the ausom sink and we are allowed to use mods. But there is one mod that I found but was outdated the Ausom points X100 ( mod link https://ficsit.app/mod/CTbhnCnW8zWWGG )  and I was wondering if someone could make a mod like this and or reach out to the mod dev  and update it if allowed and I want to make my own mods so I don&#39;t have to post these stupid forums all the time about mod ideas but I don&#39;t know how yet I am trying to find a non-gibrish guide( i can&#39;t find one that  makes any sense)</description>

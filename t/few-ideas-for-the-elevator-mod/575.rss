    <title>Few ideas for the Elevator Mod</title>

    <description>It would be nice if there were no raised fences on the elevator, if there was the option to just have a square foundation, this way the explorer car could be driven on to it and elevated.

2. would be good if a few square foundations could be snapped to together to make a larger elevator.
so that trucks could be elevated.

3. when setting the floors and hights, it would be nice if you could hide the numeric hight section after your settings have been saved. and it would be cool if &quot;during the creation of floor names and hights, that the entery could be drag and droppable. so that its easy to reorder floors if you have some above you and below you.</description>

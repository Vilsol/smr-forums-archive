    <title>Mod the hub with multiple input ports</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/mod-the-hub-with-multiple-input-ports/826</link>
    <description>Can or has anyone create a hub mod that has multiple input ports for belts?  Though I would suggest a way to unlock the smart splitter and overflow feature earlier.  Would prevent manual loading of the hub - because you know the game is all about automation...

    <title>MAM issues: Unable to research most items; Solved</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/mam-issues-unable-to-research-most-items-solved/441</link>
    <description>Only the top 3 items on the left side are researchable. The rest of the items are greyed out. The top icon in the tree for these items appears to be locked. I have never seen this before.
Early Access build 118201. I have just finished all goals to level 4. I have found Caterium for example but cannot research it.

Could this have been a result of mods? All seem to be working fine.

              <p>I found a temporary fix for this.<br>
I used the Save Game Editor to open an old file with what I needed, copied values to a text editor,and opened the save game I wanted to fix and added the elements. The link below shows where the elements may be found in the save game.</p>
<p>Note that this does not cause any research to be done, it just fixes the display so I can select the nodes allowing me to research them. Also I found in the Satisfactory log file divide by zero errors relating to MAM.</p>

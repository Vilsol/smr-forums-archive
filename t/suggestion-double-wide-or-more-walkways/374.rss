    <title>[Suggestion] Double wide (or more) walkways</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/suggestion-double-wide-or-more-walkways/374</link>
    <description>Would be a simple visual change to walkways (I think, but then again I cant do 3d stuff lol). 

Right now If you put 2 walkway crossings, T crossing, or turns next to each other, you end up with holes in the corner of the floor. Putting 4 crossings together, or getting creative with wider walk ways really gets annoying with all the holes all over. I understand why its this way vanilla, but its annoying if you want more than a single wide walkway. Also perhaps extending the rails so when 2 T crossings etc are next to each other, you cant simply walk between the railings.</description>

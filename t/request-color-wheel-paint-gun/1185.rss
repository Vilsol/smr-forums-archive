    <title>[REQUEST] Color Wheel Paint Gun</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/request-color-wheel-paint-gun/1185</link>
    <description>Simply put, would like to see a Paint Gun that has broader color selection via color wheel or something similar. That would allow for a more personal touch on our factories. Not sure how to mod for that. Would offer suggestions or request help building the mod if I could. Sadly, I am not that savvy.

Thanks!</description>

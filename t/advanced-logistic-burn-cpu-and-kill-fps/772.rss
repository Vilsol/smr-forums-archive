    <title>Advanced logistic burn CPU and kill FPS</title>
    <link>https://forums.ficsit.app/t/advanced-logistic-burn-cpu-and-kill-fps/772</link>
    <description>First is PC config
i9-9900KF + 2070S + 64GB RAM

Only Advanced logistic installed. (For find out the root cause I uninstall all mods 1 by 1)

Here a some testing. with 80 Splitters and 40 mergers that placed with foundrys

When not do any settings in the splitters/mergers, the performance is same as normal.
If don&#39;t enter the area that has Advanced logistic splitters/merges, the performance is same as normal too.

While doing settings in the splitters/merges, the CPU starts to burn, the cpu usage is raise accumulately - increasing slowly at the beginning and keep increasing very fast.

Tried to clear all items in the belt and machines, it didn&#39;t help.

Leaving the area will not recover the CPU usage and FPS drops.

RAM and GPU usage is normal, it burns the CPU only.

I really love this mod, it solved the load balancing problem while building a huge factory. I guess it maybe a problem about the counter keep accumulating. Hope it will has a fix soon.</description>
